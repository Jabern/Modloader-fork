    Q: My game just doesn't open

    Q: Do I need to have the CLEO library installed?

    Q: I've put a mod into modloader folder but nothing changes in-game

       for example: modloader/the mod name/put the modification here
       
    Q: I've put a map mod into modloader folder but nothing changes in-game
    A: Try the above, if that's not the issue make sure the IPL/IDE/IMG files are structured in the same
       way as it would go to the root game folder.
       For example: modloader/new country/data/maps/country/countryS.IPL
       This won't work: modloader/new country/countryS.IPL
       
       If it's a new IPL/IDE file, it needs a gta.dat accompanied.
