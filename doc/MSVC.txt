---> Microsoft Visual C++ Port

    An Visual Studio 2013 (MSVC 12) or above port wouldn't be hard. In fact it is easier than you'd think.
    
    "Hey man, 2010 rocks! I'll use it!"
    Unfortunately, a MSVC 10 port will be much hard and I don't it'll be worth it, C++11 is so beauty, and it's compile-time design is so cool.
    Modloader uses many C++11 features that are not present in MSVC 10 such as lambda expressions¹.
    But what about Visual Studio 2012? We used variadic templates somewhere, it might not be hard to port, but will make the code harder to read.

    So, back in MSVC 12, to port it we have just to port one single file from GNU Assembler to Microsoft Assembler syntax.
    Hey, calm down! We have only to port the directives (such as .globl, .text, etc), no need to port x86 syntax.
    I didn't use AT&T syntax, Intel syntax rocks.
    
    The problem is, I can't do it by myself, I don't have access to MSVC from Linux.
    
    So, which files is it? It is "src/plugins/std-img/backend.s"
    Just copy it and rename to "backend.asm" and fix the directives to be like MSVC.
    It's done, just create the Visual Studio Project file from CMake or the NMake file.
    Yeah, the CMakeLists is ready to support those changes.
    



¹ MSVC 10 implements a unfinished version of lambda expressions since C++11 specification wasn't ready in the time MSVC 10 was launched
