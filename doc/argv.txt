----------> gta_sa.exe command line arguments added by modloader

    OPTIONS:
    
        -mod modname
            This command line option makes modloader load only @modname folder from the root modloader folder.
            This essentially is the same as going into modloader.ini, enabling EXCLUDE_ALL, and adding @modname into [INCLUDE_MODS] section
            
            Usage example: gta_sa.exe -mod gtaunited
                Will load only the mod "modloader/gtaunited" and other mods that are in [INCLUDE_MODS] section
                However gtaunited will have 80 of priority value
